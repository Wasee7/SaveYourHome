If you’re behind on rent and facing the risk of losing your home, Save Your Home is here to support you. Landlords have the right to take legal action and summon you to court, and it’s important to attend the hearing. Courts can provide a solicitor to represent you, but if you can’t get legal representation, Save Your Home helps you prepare for your hearing.

Our app guides you through the process and helps you generate a report to present to the court on your hearing day. This ensures your case is clearly explained and your voice is heard.
